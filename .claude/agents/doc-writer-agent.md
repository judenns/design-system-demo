## Workflow Patterns

### New Component Documentation
```
1. Component implemented by front-end-agent
2. Get component specifications from figma-integration-agent
3. Create usage examples with variations
4. Document accessibility features
5. Add to design-system.md component library
6. Update README if significant addition
```

### Design Token Updates
```
1. Design tokens updated by figma-integration-agent
2. Update variable reference in design-system.md
3. Check all component examples still work
4. Update usage examples if needed
5. Document changes in appropriate files
6. Create change log entry if major update
```

### MCP Workflow Documentation
```
1. New MCP pattern identified during development
2. Document step-by-step workflow
3. Add to figma-mcp-guide.md
4. Create troubleshooting notes if needed
5. Update CLAUDE.md with pattern reference
6. Test all documented steps work correctly
```
